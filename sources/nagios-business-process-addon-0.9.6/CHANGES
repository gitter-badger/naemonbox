version 0.9.6
-------------
	Feature Request 2010-003: bp_cfg2service_cfg.pl can optional generate an
		additional notes line containing the description You did define

		use commandline switch "-n 1" if you want this

	Feature Request 2010-005: Display the timestamp when page was created
		on every page.

	Bug 2010-006 fixed: some typing errors in german

	Preformance enhancement 2010-008: when executing check_bp_status.pl, 
		the info from external_info scripts is never used
		so we do not execute them any longer for a better performance

	Feature Request 2010-009: Better integration with Icinga.
		You can use the Icinga-API by HTTP/JSON as an additional backend.
		There are Cronks to integrate the Business Process View
		directly in the new Icinga-Web.

	Feature Request 2010-009: Whithin this feature request, Business Process 
		AddOns have got a JSON-API. This means You can query state 
		information of business processes from the Nagios Business Process
		AddOns in JSON format to use the results e. g. in Your own scripts
		or for building up Your own GUI. For more info, see API-DOC.

	Bug 2010-010 fixed: on more errors we now display a helpful HTML page
		instead of a technical error

	Bug 2010-011 fixed: most generated HTML pages refresh after a certain
		amount of time. On error pages this is useless. So took the
		refresh out.

-------------
	Bug 2008-008 fixed: info_url directives did not work, if the given URL

		exist; now it should be fixed.
	Feature Request 2009-021: bp_cfg2service_cfg.pl got an additional option
		-o to tell where the result file should be created
		so You can use each path You like, e. g. directly put it into
		a cfg_dir used by Nagios
	Bug 2009-022 fixed: When using whereUsed by giving host and service name
		by HTTP referer, the URL decoding of the HTTP referer did not work 
		correct if host or service names had special characters such as / 
		(slash).
	Feature Request 2009-023: whereUsed now also works with more than one
		nagios-bp.conf
	Improofment 2009-024: rewrite of an internal used method (cutOffSpaces) 
		for more efficiency

		for getting actual status information from Nagios
		for more information, see INSTALL
	Feature Request 2009-028: when calling http://<hostname>/nagiosbp/ You
		are now redirected to the web GUI.

		needs now.
		for more information see README, section "Adapting the GUI to

	Feature Request 2009-008: when reading from NDO backend (NDO database, 
		ndo2fs, Merlin) You can now do a caching of the values we got from 
		there for a configurable amount of time to reduce the number of 
		backend requests.
		ATTENTION: Use this feature only if there is NO OTHER possibility.
		Better tune Your database.
	Feature Request 2009-011: Merlin integration

	Bug 2008-025 fixed: in the INSTALL file the section about modifying
		side.html there was an old (wrong) path
	Feature Request 2009-001: support for ndo2fs was added
		If You don't like the overhead of a database, You alternatively 
		can use ndo2fs (http://www.pnp4nagios.org/ndo2fs/start) which 
		writes the same information into the file system.
		Nagios Business Process AddOns can read them from the filesystem
		now as well.
		(But keep in mind: ndo2fs uses NDOUTILS as well, You don't save 
		the installation of NDOUTILS, but only the overhead of running 
		a database.)
	Bug 2009-002 fixed: in the Nagios plugin check_bp_status.pl the
		lib path did contain an old (wrong) path
	Feature Request 2009-003: a script was added that helps You to find
		out easyly if the connection to Your NDO works correct
