If You are updating form a version before 0.9.6 please note, there are
two more perl modules required now, JSON::XS and LWP::UserAgent, see section 
"Requirements" in INSTALL

If You want to update from version 0.9.0 or 0.9.1, there are two different 
ways:
1. keep the old path and URL settings (not recommended)
2. use the new path and URL setting

If You are updating from version 0.9.2 or later, please see section 
"Updating from version 0.9.2 or later" below.


Keep the old path and URL settings
----------------------------------

If You choose this way, You will keep path (/usr/local/nagios-ext) and URL
(http://yourhost.example.com/nagios-ext/...) as they were in previous versions.
This has the advantage, that You do not need to change any links.

Do the following steps:

Save the files of Your nagios-ext/etc directory.

Change to the directory directly above nagios-ext, by default
/usr/local
	cd /usr/local
Delete nagios-ext
	rm -f nagios-ext
If You did create a separate session directory, e. g.
/var/www/nagios_bp.sessions
You can remove this directory too:
	cd /var/www
	rm -Rf nagios_bp.sessions

Install this version as described in INSTALL and README.
As options for configure You should use something like
	./configure --with-cgiurl=/nagios-ext/cgi-bin --with-htmurl=/nagios-ext --prefix=/usr/local/nagios-ext --with-cron-d-dir=/usr/local/nagios-ext/etc/cron.d --with-httpd-conf=/usr/local/nagios-ext/etc/apache-conf.d

Restore the files in nagios-ext/etc

One change in configuration You have to do: The file which was named 
ndo_db_readonly.cfg before is now ndo.cfg and has more settings.
The best solution would be to copy ndo.cfg-sample to ndo.cfg
	cd etc
	cp ndo.cfg-sample ndo.cfg
Afterwards You take over the values You did define in ndo_db_readonly.cfg
into ndo.cfg. 

If You are updating from version 0.9.0 and Your NDO database is running on 
another host than Nagios Business Process View, You might want to completely
reconfigure Your values in the new ndo.cfg, because it's more easy now to 
configure a different host and port for the database.

Now You can delete the old ndo_db_readonly.cfg.

If You did map Your Business Processes to Nagios service, please note, 
that You also have to change the service templates and the command You did 
define in some nagios config file:
The command check_bp_status must get two parameters now, see README.

The files *-sample in nagios-ext/etc can be removed.

The symlinks You added to Your system's perl INC path pointing to *.pm files
in /usr/local/nagios-ext/sbin/ should be removed. They are not needed any 
longer (Nagios Business Process AddOns use local libs now only).
If You are unsure, which directories are in the INC path, type
                perl -e 'print join("\n", @INC) . "\n"'

That's it. Now it should work.
If You have problems, see section Help in README.


Use the new path and URL setting
--------------------------------

If You choose this way, You will install into the new default path 
(/usr/local/nagiosbp) and URL (http://yourhost.example.com/nagiosbp/...)
This has the advantage, that You are closer to the standard of 0.9.2
and further versions.

Do the following steps:

Save the files of Your nagios-ext/etc directory.

Change to the directory directly above nagios-ext, by default
/usr/local
	cd /usr/local
Delete nagios-ext
	rm -f nagios-ext
If You did create a separate session directory, e. g.
/var/www/nagios_bp.sessions
You can remove this directory too:
	cd /var/www
	rm -Rf nagios_bp.sessions

If You did create a cronjob, for cleaning up old session information, You
can remove this one now. You probably have some line like
*/10 * * * * /usr/local/nagios-ext/bin/nagios_bp_session_timeout 2>&1 | logger -t nagios_bp_session_timeout
in the crontab of the user Your webserver is running under.
Remove it.

On install of Your previous version, You did add some lines in Your httpd.conf
(one ScriptAlias, one Alias and two directory directives - search for the string
nagios-ext). Remove them. You will get a separate config file in apache's conf.d
directory afterwards, when installing the new version.

Now Your installation is as clean as we need it for the installation of the
new version.
(the only things we left over are Links in Nagios's side.html and some host
and service templates and commands You did define in some Nagios config
file - You will change them later)
 
Now it's time to install this new version as described in INSTALL and README.

When You are at the point to add two links to Nagios' side.html remember to
just change the links there instead of inserting them.

If You come to the section
Business Process representation as Nagios services
and You did map Your Business Processes to Nagios service before, please note, 
that You also have to change the service templates and the command You did 
define in some nagios config file:
The command check_bp_status must get two parameters now, see README.

Now You can restore the files in nagios-ext/etc

One change in configuration You have to do: The file which was named 
ndo_db_readonly.cfg before is now ndo.cfg and has more settings.
The best solution would be to copy ndo.cfg-sample to ndo.cfg
	cd etc
	cp ndo.cfg-sample ndo.cfg
Afterwards You take over the values You did define in ndo_db_readonly.cfg
into ndo.cfg. 

If You are updating from version 0.9.0 and Your NDO database is running on 
another host than Nagios Business Process View, You might want to completely
reconfigure Your values in the new ndo.cfg, because it's more easy now to 
configure a different host and port for the database.

Now You can delete the old ndo_db_readonly.cfg.

The files *-sample in nagios-ext/etc can be removed.

The symlinks You added to Your system's perl INC path pointing to *.pm files
in /usr/local/nagios-ext/sbin/ should be removed. They are not needed any 
longer (Nagios Business Process AddOns use local libs now only).
If You are unsure, which directories are in the INC path, type
                perl -e 'print join("\n", @INC) . "\n"'

That's it. Now it should work.
If You have problems, see section Help in README.


Updating from version 0.9.2 or later
------------------------------------

Save the files of Your nagiosbp/etc/ directory and share/stylesheets/user.css
(just to be sure).

Now You do an normal installation, see INSTALL. 
As parameters for the configure script You should use the same parameters
You did use when installing the previous version!
The section about editing side.html: You do not have to do this again!
Also You did already create the read-only user for the database last time.

One change in configuration You have to do: The file which was named 
ndo_db_readonly.cfg before in 0.9.2 is now ndo.cfg and has more settings.
The best solution would be to copy ndo.cfg-sample to ndo.cfg
	cd etc
	cp ndo.cfg-sample ndo.cfg
Afterwards You take over the values You did define in ndo_db_readonly.cfg
into ndo.cfg. The other settings in ndo.cfg You do not need to change.

Now You can delete the old ndo_db_readonly.cfg and all *-sample config files.

That's it. Now You should be on the new version and everything should be working.
If You have problems, see section Help in README.
