# Business Process AddOns for Nagios and Icinga get actual data from Nagios or Icinga
# via the NDO or IDO interface
# Nagios or Icinga can write the NDO/IDO data into a database (ndo2db) or into the
# filesystem (ndo2fs) or use Merlin database or the Icinga-Web JSON API
# also they can be asked for directly from Nagios/Icinga using mk_livestatus
#
# this file configures, where to take this information from
# in releases up to 0.9.2 this file was called ndo_db_readonly.cfg
# (because up to this point, the database was the only supported interface)

# tells if NDO/IDO data is to be taken from a NDO database (db), from Merlin database
# (merlin), from the filesystem (fs), from mk_livestatus (mk_livestatus)
# or Icinga-Web API (icinga-web)
# allowed values are db, merlin, fs, mk_livestatus or icinga-web

# Cache
# starting with version 0.9.4 You can configure to cache states we just got from
# the database or filesystem so that the next process can use them
# especially if You have a big installation of Nagios Business Process AddOns
# and have configured the business processes to be Nagios Services, this can
# bring You much speed with much lower load on Your monitoring server
# but the results are not so fresh as they could be
# so You decide!

# for this time in seconds states are cached
cache_time=0
# where to store cached states
